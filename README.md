# InDesignScript_change_upper_lower_in_style
Change case in one paragraph style with some predefined regular expressions.

Changing case is realized without the paragraph style's property: text is directly modified (useful when exporting in epub, since Adobe Digital Editions can't interpret a css property like text-transform).

The language used in the GUI of the script is italian.
